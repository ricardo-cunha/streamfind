// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Runtime ISA dispatch.
//
// A single binary can carry several builds of the two batched fill kernels --
// one per instruction-set level -- and pick the best one the CPU actually
// supports, at run time. This matters because the distributed builds have no
// -march at all (the PyPI wheel is compiled at the x86-64 baseline, so its
// vectors are 2 doubles wide), while the machines running them are mostly
// AVX2-or-better.
//
// Why it is built this way, and not the two obvious easier ways:
//
//   * __attribute__((target(...))) / target_clones() cannot do it.
//     std::experimental::simd fixes its ABI when the templates are instantiated,
//     from the -march preprocessor macros; a target attribute applied afterwards
//     changes only the *encoding*. Measured: fixed_size_simd<double,8> inside a
//     target("avx512f") function on a baseline TU emits nothing but xmm, and
//     native_simd<double> under target_clones still reports 2 lanes. So the
//     levels have to be separate translation units, each with its own -march.
//
//   * Those TUs must not include the library's own headers. A TU compiled at
//     -march=x86-64-v4 emits VEX/EVEX code into the COMDAT copies of every
//     inline and template function it instantiates, and the linker then picks
//     one copy of each for the whole program -- by link order. Measured: the
//     same two objects linked in the opposite order gave a surviving copy of a
//     shared inline function using %zmm, reachable from baseline code paths,
//     i.e. SIGILL on any CPU without AVX-512.
//
// Hence the interface below is deliberately POD-only: raw pointers and doubles,
// no IsoSpec types, nothing with a definition that could be duplicated. The
// kernel bodies (isa_kernel_impl.h) are static, and only the tables below have
// external linkage. libstdc++'s simd internals are all always_inline, so they
// leave no mergeable symbols behind either -- verified with nm on both TUs.

    A stable lowercase token, never NULL and never to be freed: one of

      - "scalar"  -- no vectorisation at all. Either the standard library has no
                     <experimental/simd> (MSVC, and Apple Clang's libc++), or the
                     build disabled the SIMD path; every configuration goes
                     through the scalar drain and the kernels are do-nothing stubs.
      - "sse2"    -- x86-64's guaranteed baseline, 2 doubles per vector.
      - "avx"     -- 4 doubles, no FMA (a -march build targeting pre-Haswell x86).
      - "avx2"    -- x86-64-v3: AVX2+FMA, 4 doubles.
      - "avx512"  -- x86-64-v4: AVX-512F/BW/DQ/VL, 8 doubles.
      - "neon"    -- AArch64's guaranteed baseline, 2 doubles.
      - "simd"    -- vectorised, on an architecture this function has no name for.

    This is a finer-grained question than current_isa_level(), and deliberately
    so: that one names the dispatch bucket, which says nothing about whether the
    bucket's kernels vectorise. A build whose standard library lacks the SIMD
    header still reports level "baseline" while running entirely scalar -- the
    case this function exists to make visible.

    New tokens may be added as levels are; treat an unrecognised one as "some
    vector unit", not as an error.
